# Tenth Tone — Social Video App

Clickable frontend prototype of a TikTok-style Arabic social video app, built from the SRS document. RTL Arabic, mobile-first, **PWA-installable on iPhone**, no build step, no backend (mock data).

## Run

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Syed\Desktop\social-app"
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open:
- **Mobile app:** http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
- **Admin dashboard:** http://127.0.0.1:5500/admin.html

## Install on iPhone (PWA)

The app is a Progressive Web App — it installs to the home screen, runs fullscreen with no browser chrome, and works offline.

### To install on a real iPhone

1. **Make the dev server reachable from your phone.**
   Easiest path: deploy to a free static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages). PWAs require **HTTPS** outside `localhost`, and your phone needs to reach the URL.

   Quick options:
   - **Netlify drop:** drag the `social-app/` folder onto https://app.netlify.com/drop → instant HTTPS URL
   - **Vercel:** `npx vercel` in the folder
   - **Cloudflare Pages:** connect the repo
   - **Local-only test:** run `npx serve --ssl` on your laptop, get the IP, open in iPhone Safari (you'll get a cert warning to bypass)

2. On the iPhone, open the URL in **Safari** (not Chrome — iOS PWA install only works through Safari).

3. Tap the **Share** button (the square with the up-arrow at the bottom of Safari).

4. Scroll and tap **"Add to Home Screen"** (إضافة إلى الشاشة الرئيسية).

5. Confirm the name "Tenth Tone" and tap **Add**.

6. The app icon appears on your home screen. Launching it opens fullscreen with no browser bar — looks and feels like a native app.

### What works in PWA mode
- ✅ Home-screen icon, splash screen, fullscreen layout
- ✅ Offline support (service worker caches the app shell)
- ✅ App-like navigation (no browser chrome)
- ✅ Add to Siri / Spotlight search

### iOS PWA limitations
- ❌ Push notifications (limited; iOS 16.4+ supports web push but only when installed)
- ❌ Background sync
- ❌ Some camera/file APIs are restricted vs native apps
- ❌ Not in App Store (use Capacitor for that — see "Next steps" below)

### Verifying the PWA locally

Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest / Service Workers. You should see:
- Manifest loaded correctly
- Service worker registered and activated
- "Install" button available in Chrome (omnibox)

## What's mocked / not wired

- **No backend:** all data lives in `js/data.js`. State changes during a session reset on reload.
- **No real video playback:** feed uses still images as placeholders.
- **No real auth:** any login/register button advances the flow.
- **No real-time:** chat and live comments don't actually push.
- **Avatars:** loaded from `i.pravatar.cc`.
- **Background images:** loaded from `images.unsplash.com`.
